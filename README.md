## Guitar & Amp Repair Shop

Built for the shop owner who just wants a website that works and doesn’t talk back. This .NET MVC project gives you a clean front page, a snappy image carousel, and a responsive gallery — all wrapped in a mobile-friendly design.

On the backend, there’s a file manager for uploading photos, a password changer for when paranoia kicks in, and solid Identity-based authentication.

Think of it like a vintage amp: reliable, no unnecessary knobs, and easy to maintain.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The site is hosted on a free Render server that sleeps when inactive. If the page doesn't load right away, just give it **20–30 seconds** - it'll wake up.
